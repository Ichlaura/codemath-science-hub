## Project: CodeMath Science Hub API
**Course:** CSE341 - Web Backend Development  
**Date:** October 2024  
**Project Type:** Individual

## Contribution 1: Complete API Architecture and Infrastructure
- **Designed and implemented the entire project structure** following MVC pattern
- **Set up Express.js server** with middleware configuration (CORS, JSON parsing, error handling)
- **Configured environment variables** and security settings for development and production
- **Implemented folder structure** with clear separation of concerns (controllers, models, routes, middleware, config)
- **Set up package.json** with all necessary dependencies and scripts

## Contribution 2: Database Models and API Endpoints
- **Created User model** with comprehensive validation (email, role, children data, timestamps)
- **Created Product model** with educational product specifications (category, age range, price, type)
- **Implemented CRUD operations** for both collections with proper error handling
- **Designed RESTful API endpoints** following best practices
- **Added data validation** and sanitization for all inputs

## Contribution 3: Authentication and Error Handling System

- **Set up automatic API documentation** at `/api-docs` route
- **Deployed application to Render** with proper environment configuration
- **Configured GitHub integration** for continuous deployment
- **Created comprehensive README** with setup instructions

## Contribution 5: Project Setup and Configuration
- **Initialized Git repository** and managed version control
- **Set up development environment** with nodemon for hot reloading
- **Configured MongoDB connection** with fallback handling
- **Implemented health check routes** and API status monitoring
- **Created project documentation** and file structure

## Technical Skills Demonstrated:
- **Backend Development:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/Mongoose
- **API Design:** RESTful principles, CRUD operations, endpoint planning
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens, middleware implementation
- **Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI, API documentation
